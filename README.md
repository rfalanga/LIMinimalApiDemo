Project developed following a demo on Minimal API on LinkedIn

## The source for this demo

This article on LinkedIn that this demo comes from, can be [found here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/getting-started-minimal-api-net-6-vijayanath-vijay-viswanathan)

### Notes

Following the LinkedIn tutorial for this project back in 2022, it was written using .NET 6 with Visual Studio 2022.

However, on 3/15/2025 I converted this project to .NET 9.

### This is a LinkedIn article

On my laptop I've put this into a folder for LinkedIn Learning. Technically, this project is not from a LinkedIn Learning course. This is from an article on LinkedIn, publisched back in 2022. I'm just putting under my LinkedIn Learning folder on my laptop, because I don't want to bother creating another folder for LinkedIn articles.

On my desktop at home this project is under my GitHub folder. (So, I'm inconsistent with where I put this project on my laptop and desktop.)

## Adding a GitHub Action

On 3/15/2025 I added a GitHub Action to this project. The action is triggered on push and pull requests to the main branch.
